#
This repository is a subset for [main project]("https://github.com/defensetongxue/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection") providing an interface for facial landmark detection.

In `predict.py`, I will provide the coodinate for the keypoints detect. please see the code.

For annotations, the model provide 98 points annotations. you can follow the guid in [dataset source link]('https://wywu.github.io/projects/LAB/WFLW.html')
# Note
If you want to use this code, the follow cite has to be added, the former 2 are for the model and the last is for dataset.
